One function of operating systems is memory management.  Programs that are running need to be placed into RAM to have interactions with the CPU.  The operating system manages which programs and data occupy space in the RAM, sometimes swapping them in and out when the RAM is full.
Another function of operating systems is providing a user interface.  This provides the user with a way to display programs and data to the user and provide that user with a way to interact with it and input information.  The most common way is with a graphical UI that the user manipulates with a keyboard and mouse or a touchscreen.
